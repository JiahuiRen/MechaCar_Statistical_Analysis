# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
# Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.
In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Below is what we got for coefficients

Residual value of min and max is |19.47| and |18.58|,with median of 0.07.
The slope of a linear model is not zero.  It can be seen that there are significant non-zero values in slope coefficient, and all p values are lower than the significant level of P =0.05.
